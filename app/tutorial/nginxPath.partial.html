		Brenda-Web leverages Nginx in order to monitor the status of each worker.
	</p>
    <p>
    	Nginx is a lightweight web server.  Once installed, the default configuration
    	serves static files from a particular directory on the worker machine.  The
    	Nginx Path field tells Brenda-Web where that default directory is located.
    	If using one of the AMI Preset links, this field will autopopulate with the
    	appropriate value.  This field only needs to be changed if using a custom
    	AMI instance.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Custom AMI images will typically be created by starting from an Ubuntu image.  The
    	Ubuntu version that is used will affect the location of the Nginx default
    	directory.  The table below shows the recent LTS Ubuntu versions and the default
    	directory location for each.
